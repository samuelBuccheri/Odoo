Hello guys,

First, I want to say that I’m very motivated to join your team and make good work together. ;-)
I’ve tried my best to make the code of this mockup, but I have made some little improvement.

I think that’s a clear and nice mockup design but, in a user-experienced view, a page with that height is not very good according to me because the users have to scroll a lot before seeing all the elements of the page and we all know that most of the time, they don’t scroll that much so most of content are “lost”.

To make this design looks better in a user-experienced view I have made the “navbar” fixed.
Like this the user can have the menu anytime in a hand.
Moreover, I added a “scrollTop button” if the user, who have scrolled, want to go directly to the top of the page.

In a user-interface view, I have added a nice text effect on the campaign slider of the page.
It’s a nice trend feature to make the website looks better.

I hope that you will find the work good and that we can drink a coffee or a beer together.

Thanks,
See you soon,
